What Does the Fox Say
===============
*What Does the Fox Say* is a game developed for the *Computaci칩n Gr치fica* course at EAFIT University. The aim fo the game is to be able to exactly repeat random sequences of colors.

Description
----
The game was developed for apply concepts seen in *Computaci칩n Gr치fica* course at EAFIT University. This game used the *Graphics 2D* library of **Java**, and involves circles, vectors and matrices operations. The game involves graphic object operations, such as **scale, rotate** and **translate**.

The main idea is to exactly repeat random sequences of colors that are shown before each turn. The player must wait until the sequence is totally described, then try to repeat it perfectly. When a sequence is achieved, the game becomes more difficult and the number of steps in a sequence increases by two.

Controls
----
* **Mouse**: Use left-click to follow the sequence described.

Development
-----
The game was developed using **Java**, with *Graphics 2D* library.
